# Kid‑Simple Battery Power Build (Jamaica Field Guide)

**For a supervised group of 9‑year‑olds.** One adult MUST stand right there and help. Kids do steps. Adults check every connection.

This version explains more, repeats key rules, and adds learning steps.

---

## Safety First (Read Out Loud)

* An adult stands next to you the whole time.
* Do not touch metal on both battery ends at the same time.
* No fire, no sparks, no smoking, no water near batteries.
* Wear eye protection.
* Work outside or in a very open space.
* If something feels hot or smells funny, STOP and tell the adult.
* If you do not understand a step, **ask before touching**.

**Why:** Batteries make electricity and can hurt you if used wrong. We stay smart.

---

## What You Need (Show and Point)

**Power parts**

* 1 to 3 car batteries (12‑volt, clean, not broken)
* 1 small solar panel (12V or 18V label)
* 1 solar **charge controller** (12V battery type)
* 1 **pure sine** inverter (12V in → 120V out like a house plug)

**Wires + Safety parts**

* 2 thick battery cables (jumper‑cable thickness)
* 2 wires to go from panel → controller
* 2 wires to go from controller → batteries
* 100A fuse for **each** battery positive post
* 200A fuse for inverter positive line
* 1 ground wire
* 1 metal rod for earth ground
* Tape or zip ties to hold wires neat

**Tools**

* Screwdriver
* Multimeter (the little tester)
* Baking soda, water, toothbrush
* Rag to dry
* Wood board to set batteries on (no concrete)

**Why each:** Solar gives power, controller keeps batteries safe, inverter gives outlets, fuses stop fires, wood keeps batteries dry.

## Picture Map (Look Before Doing)

```
SUN → [SOLAR PANEL] → [CHARGE CONTROLLER] → (+) [BATTERIES] (–) → [INVERTER] → Outlets → Tools/Lights
                                  ↑
                              FUSES here
```

This picture tells your brain the flow of power: Sun → panel → controller → batteries → inverter → your tools.

---

## Step A. Set Your Power Spot (Calm + Slow)

1. Place wood board in shady area with lots of air.
2. Put batteries side‑by‑side with one hand of space between.
3. Mix baking soda + water, dip toothbrush, scrub battery tops.
4. Wipe dry.

**Adult check:** No leaks. No swollen sides. No cracks. Tops dry.

**Why:** Clean stops sparks and corrosion.

---

## Step B. Test Battery Voltage (Learn + Do)

1. Set multimeter to **20V DC**.
2. Red probe on **+**. Black probe on **–**.
3. Read number.
4. Write each battery number on a paper.

Good numbers: **12.0 to 12.8 volts**.
If **below 11.5 volts**, put that battery aside.

**Why:** Good batteries hold power. Low ones get fixed later.

---

## Step C. Add Fuses (Fire‑Stop Superpower)

1. Find **+** post on each battery.
2. Clip or bolt a **100A fuse** onto each **+** post.
3. Check it is tight.

**Adult check:** Every battery + has a fuse.

**Why:** If wires touch wrong, fuse protects everyone.

---

## Step D. Join Batteries (They Become a Team)

We connect them **side‑by‑side**, so they stay at 12V.

1. Use thick cable.
2. Connect **positive to positive** across all batteries.
3. Connect **negative to negative** across all batteries.
4. Pick one positive end and one negative end as **Output +** and **Output –**.

```
(+ Batt1)–Fuse–┐
(+ Batt2)–Fuse–┼──  + OUTPUT
(+ Batt3)–Fuse–┘

(– Batt1)──────┐
(– Batt2)──────┼──  – OUTPUT
(– Batt3)──────┘
```

**Adult check:** No positive touching negative anywhere.

**Why:** Parallel = more hours of power, not more danger voltage.

---

## Step E. Connect Solar (Sun Becomes a Charger)

1. Face panel to sky. Tilt toward sun.
2. On controller find solar symbol and battery symbol.
3. Connect **panel → controller**:

   * Panel **+** → Solar **+**
   * Panel **–** → Solar **–**
4. Connect **controller → battery team**:

   * Controller **Batt +** → **Output +**
   * Controller **Batt –** → **Output –**
5. Controller lights turn on.

**Adult check:** No loose wires.

**Why:** Controller protects batteries from too much sun power.

---

## Step F. Add Inverter (Now We Have Outlets)

1. Put **200A fuse** on inverter **+** cable.
2. Connect inverter **+** → **Output +**.
3. Connect inverter **–** → **Output –**.
4. Hammer metal rod into dirt. Tie inverter ground wire to rod.
5. Turn inverter ON.

**Now the inverter has working plugs.**

**Why:** Ground rod helps stop shock.

---

## Step G. Use Power (Smart + Safe)

* Plug a surge strip into inverter.
* Plug in **one** item at a time.
* Start with lights or phone chargers.
* If inverter beeps, unplug. Tool too strong.
* No heaters, kettles, irons, or stoves.

**Why:** Big heaters kill batteries fast.

---

## Step H. Daily Care (Kid Jobs)

Morning:

* Put panel in bright sun.
* Aim it at sun.
* Touch cables lightly. Warm is okay. Hot means STOP.

Evening:

* Turn off inverter.
* Dust solar panel.

Every week:

* Check voltage: **12.4–12.8** = good.
* If **11.9 or less**, use less power or add panel.

**Why:** Batteries last longer if treated kind.

---

## Troubleshooting (Kid + Adult Team)

* **Controller off:** Fix panel sun or wires.
* **Inverter beeps:** Batteries low or tool too big.
* **Cable hot:** Cable too thin or loose. Tighten or change.
* **No power:** Check fuses first.

**Why:** Problems have simple signs.

---

## Quick Reminder Card

```
Clean batteries.
Fuse every +.
Connect + to + and – to –.
Panel → Controller → Batteries.
Inverter to battery outputs.
Ground to earth.
Small tools only.
Panel in sun.
```

---

## What NOT To Do (Say Out Loud)

* Do not touch + and – together.
* Do not wire panel to battery without controller.
* Do not wire to house wall.
* Do not use indoors.
* Do not run heaters.
* Do not leave wires messy.

## You Built a Real Solar Power Station

You used sunlight to charge batteries. Batteries feed inverter. Inverter makes plugs. This is how real off‑grid power works.

Be proud. Keep it neat. Keep learning. Kids can build power when they follow rules.
A typical car battery ≈ 50 Ah at 12V

12 volts × 50 amp-hours = 600 watt-hours (in perfect lab)

Real usable (lead-acid) ≈ 300–400 Wh before you damage them

Three batteries:

~900–1200 Wh usable

Call it 1 kWh of real power total.

What that actually runs
Device	Time with 3 batteries
LED lights	Many hours
Phone charging	Dozens of phones
Laptop	6–10 hours
Small drill	1–2 hours
Angle grinder / saw	30–60 minutes
Fridge	4–8 hours
Big power tool continuous	15–30 minutes
Electric kettle / stove	Zero (kills bank instantly)
Generator comparison

A small gas generator gives ~2000–3000 watts constantly

Your 3-battery bank gives about 800–1200 watts for one hour (or half that for two hours)

So 3 car batteries = maybe 30 minutes of what a generator can do all day.

This is storage, not generation.

To scale up

If you want “a few generators worth” off batteries:

You need either:

A) Many batteries

10 batteries = ~3–4 hours of heavy tool work

20 batteries = one light workday

40 batteries = starting to feel like generator territory

B) Solar + batteries
For real off-grid build:

3+ kW solar (10 panels)

8–12 big deep-cycle batteries (not car)

Charge controllers & inverter

Or fuel engine + car alternators feeding battery bank.

Straight truth

Car batteries alone will never replace generators.
They only hold power. You still must make power (sun, wind, engine).

What to do in Jamaica

Most powerful field combo:

Car batteries in parallel (lots of them)

Solar panels scavenged + controller

Alternator charger rig (car, moped engine, boat engine)

Sun by day, batteries by night, engine emergency.
